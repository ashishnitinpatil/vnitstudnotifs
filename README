Project - VNIT STUDENT NOTIFICATIONS UPDATES
CREATOR - Ashish Nitin Patil aka !mmorta!
CREATED - 12th of June, 2013 (v2)
UPDATED - 1st of January, 2014 (v4)

Summary of the Project -
	The app runs 'cron' jobs periodically (as per settings in cron.yaml),
	checking for any new updates on the Student Notifications page.
	If there are any new links, they are stored in the database,
	& the corresponding link title is tweeted on '@VNITStudNotifs' (Twitter).
    With the help of IFTTT recipe 137489, we post the tweets on the
    FaceBook page facebook.com/vnitstudnotifs.
	The app.yaml contains url Handler settings, which runs the main.py.
	The .html files are templates used by the corresponding url Handlers.
	The tweepy directory contains the "tweepy" twitter library for python.
    The bs4 directory contains the "BeautifulSoup4" library for python.
